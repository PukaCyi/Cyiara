# Archived
Archiving this because I find it stupid, and I want to just overall restart. To see the new version of this, click [here](https://github.com/PukaCyi/pukacyi.github.io).

If you're reading this from the future, you still have to abide by the local license set here. That does not expire, I think - I have zero clue on how it works lmao.

# Cyi's Thingy
Created this out of boredom. The entire thing is open source, so feel free to experiment with it (though I don't recommend it because it's messy, and I dislike it a lot.)

This is currently in-dev, and the site may break or may have already broken. If that's the case, feel free to issue a ticket (if you want - or not, I can't force you.)

# Warning
Assets (from the global folder or other unlisted folders) may have been pulled from external platforms. The credits below attribute the respective owners' properties, creations, etc. as well as other people for stuff lol.

# License
This license is under the Apache shit lol - You're free to do whatever you want (I think, I probably still retain some right to my work), but just be sure to credit and what not. Or even better, do your research and read the entire thing so that I don't have to type this boring long ass text that is pretty much meaningless also Kyle in Wii Deleted You sucks but that's besides the point.
