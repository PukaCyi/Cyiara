# Cyi's thingy
Created for the boredom and stuff. Everything here is open source (obviously, look where you're at).

This is a in-dev project - Things are expected to be broken, so please submit an issue ticket if you want :D (gladly appreciate it).

## Warning
Assets here is more than likely pulled from another site, see credits below for more info.

# License
This license is under the Apache shit lol - You're free to do whatever you want (I think, I probably still retain some right to my work), but just be sure to credit and what not. Or even better, do your research and read the entire thing so that I don't have to type this boring long ass text that is pretty much meaningless also Kyle in Wii Deleted You sucks but that's besides the point.
